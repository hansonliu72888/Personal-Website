            <div class="work-idea">Inspiration</div>
            <div class="work-description">The inspiration for DayTrips came from my experience in planning trips to Toronto. When doing so, I felt there was a lack of planning resources, so my team created a practical tool to plan for transit, events, and more.</div>
            <div class="work-height"></div>
            <div class="work-idea">What It Does</div>
            <div class="work-description">DayTrips allows users to select from a list of major cities, view popular attractions, and access maps and distances between locations. Based on the user's input parameters, the app will provide them with a visual representation of the route on the built-in map along with the distance between locations.</div>
